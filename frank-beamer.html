An interesting fact about him is that he is the descendant of the infamous Allen Clan of Carrol County in Virginia.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beamer-deep-in-tought-300x200.jpg><p>Likewise, Frank’s great-uncle named Floyd Allen fired rounds of a gunshot in a courtroom that killed five people, including the judge, prosecutor, and the county sheriff, due to his ill-temper.</p><p>When Frank was seven years old, he almost died due to a fire accident. As per reports, Frank used a push broom to maintain burning trash in place. He did not see the fire in the broom and placed the broom back in the garage.</p><p>The broom caught a small can of gasoline and caused a fire. His eleven-year-old brother saved Frank by rolling his body around the ground.</p><p>As a result of this incident, Frank had to go through skin reconstruction surgery multiple times and has permanent scarring in his shoulders, chest, and right side of the neck.</p><p>As a teenager, Frank Beamer attended a high school in Hillsville, Virginia. Additionally, his brilliance in sports earned him eleven varsity letters in three different sports: football, basketball, and baseball.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank Beamer went to college to Virginia Tech, where he played football as the starting quarterback for three years, from 1966 to 1968.&nbsp;</p><p>For his graduate studies, he chose Radford University, and at the same time, he worked as the Radford High School assistant coach.

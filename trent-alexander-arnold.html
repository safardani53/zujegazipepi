2018.</p><p>After that, Trent was featured in the World Cup for the first time against Belgium.</p><p>Sadly, that was the only appearance for Trent at the 2018 World Cup as he had to make way for the first-choice right-back, Kieran Trippier<strong>.</strong></p><p>Nevertheless, Arnold gained valuable World Cup experience, which was handy in his club career.</p><p>Subsequently, Trent got featured for England at the inaugural UEFA Nations League, in which they finished third.</p><p>He has made nine appearances for the England national team, in which he scored one goal.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Liverpool product has not cemented a starting spot in the national team due to fierce competition from <strong>Kieran Trippier</strong>, <strong>Kyle Walker</strong>, and <strong>Aron Wan</strong> Bissaka.</p><p>Nevertheless, we believe that Arnold will become England’s no.1 right-back in the coming future.</p><h2>Should Trent Alexander | Will Arnold Be In England’s World Cup Squad?</h2><p>Arnold the Liverpool right-back was likely to be starting for England at the World Cup, however, he could miss out on the squad because of an injury.</p><p>Gary Neville believes ‘rash’

which means that all the clubs playing in the league are extremely rich.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it should be no surprise that Trent has accrued a net worth of <strong>$3.16 million</strong> through his soccer activities.</p><p>Likewise, with a&nbsp;market value of<strong> $109 million (€110.00 million)</strong>, earlier Arnold was ranked the number 1 defender worldwide.</p><p>Furthermore, Trent earned £40,000 per week or $2.36 million (£2.08 million) per year with Liverpool Football Club, which was a massive sum.</p><p>On the contrary, just back in 2016, Trent earned a measly $709619 (£6,24,000) per year with the Merseyside club.</p><p>In 2021, Alexander-Arnold earned a base salary of $1.06 million (£9,360,000) while carrying a cap hit of $1.06 million (£9,360,000).</p><p>According to a clause in 2022 Trent’s contract, which allowed the Liverpool native to increase his salary based on the number of performances, Arnold increased his salary to $2.36 million (£2.08 million) per year.</p><p>Nevertheless, judging by England’s performances until now, nobody will be surprised if his wage is increased even more.</p><p>Thus, we are confident that Trent

He is an American by nationality and has black ethnicity.</p><p>Leki’s parents hail from Tonga, a Polynesian island nation in the Pacific Ocean, more than 3,000 miles east of Australia, but they moved to America when he took birth.&nbsp;</p><p>But migrating was not that easy; they stayed undocumented and did not work.</p><p>They just adjusted with Toa being a caregiver and Likiliki being a landscaper. By 1998, they were thriving equally hard to save up money for a permanent flat.</p><p>That’s when she got pregnant with Leki, which turned out to be the toughest pregnancy as she was fighting against pneumonia at the same time.</p><p>She could not digest food for three months, which led to a doctor’s ultimate suggestion to have an abortion. After that, she was just skin and bones, unhealthy.</p><p>However, staying strong throughout everything helped, and Leki was born. After his birth, Likiliki and Toa had more babies, David and Ema.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Leki-with-his-father-and-siblings-300x142.png><p>Eight years after, in 2004, Toa paid $17,000 to a legal advisor to apply for permanent residency overstaying their visas. And shortly, they were allowed with the work permits.</p><p>Further, Toa began working as a caregiver, and she was allowed to work at both places, a private home and as a certified nursing assistant.</p><p>Likiliki was suffering from health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure.</p><p>The decision to work was all in favor of Likiliki to stay at home and take care of the family, including six children, while Toa becomes the breadwinner.</p><h3>Likiliki on being a housemaker</h3><p>Likiliki completely nailed the role as a housemaker. He was terribly enjoying it. Not to mention, the family had to quest harder for money, but love soared in an ample amount.</p><p>He had the whole breakfast set-up on the table and made sure nothing went lacking in the house as in grocery wise.</p><p>He tried his level best. Fotu’s responsibilities were not only limited to the family members to the outsiders too.</p><p><strong>You might be interested in reading:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>&lt;&lt;Paolo Banchero Bio: Early Life, Career, Girlfriend, ESPN & Net Worth >></strong></a></p><h3>Life-Changing Moment</h3><p>When Likiliki and Toa lived in Tonga, Likiliki earned his money working as a DJ at nightclubs.</p><p>In the US, while the couple was saving up for a permanent residence, they were saving up a few for the DJ&nbsp; kit.</p><p>As per their plan, If Likiliki gets part-time work after having the much-needed equipment, they could make around $200 and $300 per gig.</p><p>Similarly, Likiiki received one such offer to play his tracks at a family member’s graduation party at a San Francisco Hotel in June 2006.</p><p>Out of nowhere, he just asked Toa, Alice, to join in for the event and bring Ema along.</p><p>Later, Ema just went out of her way, and in a moment, she just hopped into the open elevator, which elevated a few floors above.</p><p>And while seeing a potted plant, she just missed her balance and fell.&nbsp;They immediately rushed to the hospital, but nothing worked.</p><p>Sadly, she lost her life. Ema was just three years old, and Toa was eight; she was the light of the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lekis-three-year-old-sister-Emma-who-is-no-more-300x181.png><p>According to Toa, the first five children of theirs were quite calm, reserved, and silent. On the contrary, Ema was quite different.</p><p>She was loud, cheerful, jolly. While the rest of her kids were an introvert, Ema stood as an excellent extrovert.</p><p>Ema just pulled everyone’s attention; she usually peeked into her mother’s wardrobe and wore oversized dresses and high heels.</p><p>The next day when Toa uttered the whole moment to Leki, he did not understand anything, but he knew Ema was not coming home. That simply broke everyone’s heart.</p><p>Also, as per Leki, if Ema were alive, she would probably be the most popular girl in the school because of her charming and attractive demeanor.</p><h3>The aftermath of the incident</h3><p>The playful saddening incident took on his dad quite seriously. The young gentleman, Likiliki, who was already battling several health issues, could not take the loss of his little girl.</p><p>He was dripped into depression and anxiety as if he had lost his soul, which kept mourning for his darling daughter Ema.</p><p>Just a month after his daughter passed, his body was not in that shape to battle the sadness and grief.</p><p>His blood pressure rose, his diabetes heightened, and he suffered a stroke. In about a two-month period of time, Leki lost his 3-years-old sister and his father.</p><h3>Everything falling into places</h3><p>Well, as they say, there are no rainbows without rain. Something similar applied to their life.</p><p>Everything started falling into places. Likiliki’s first cousin, Viliami Mafi, offered help raising her family and later married Toa as well in 2010.</p><p>They migrated from Oakland to San Leandro. Viliami also guided the path for Leki and his brothers. He became a justified helping hand.</p><p>Toa continued her profession as a caregiver and started a home-care agency two years down the line. She hired her own employees and was able to serve her children at home.</p><h3>Football in the genes</h3><p>It’s a promulgated fact that Leki is the brother of the other three football players.</p><p>Though his father was 5 feet 8 inches, he and his brother inherited the height thing quite bizarrely. All the brothers aced to having a height of at least 6 feet 5 inches.</p><p>Joe and Anthony were the first to play football. Joe, taking up the advice of the counselor, ended up playing at Illinois to get his frustration out.</p><p>Anthony made way for Arizona and West Georgia. His younger brother, David, plays at Utah. They also played Rugby and were titled All-American.</p><p>Besides being a football player, his elder brothers established themselves as the best father figure in the absence of their birth father to Leki.</p><h2>How old is Leki Fotu?

His team went on grabbing the Utah 5A state championship in his senior year.</p><h2>Leki Fotu | College Career</h2><p>Leki went on to choose Utah over USC, Brigham Young, and Oklahoma State.

Well, he just proved himself from the very beginning, as a freshman, when he appeared for his first game.</p><p>He went on playing from defensive end to offensive tackle. But in the end, Leki instead opted to play defensive tackle and grabbed the starting spot.</p><p>By his junior season, he was titled to first-team all-Pac-12 Conference. Notably, ESPN also named him a preseason All-American.</p><p>After venturing for a game against California Golden Bears Football, Leki grabbed the “Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week” after scoring a 13- yard sack.</p><p>Further, the Associated Press titled him with the honor of second-team midseason All-American.</p><p>You can find the college stats of Leki Fotu on the <a href=#>ProFootballReference website</a>.</p><h2>Leki Fotu | Professional Career</h2><p>Arizona Cardinals hired Leki in the fourth round with the 114th overall pick of the 2020 NFL draft.</p><p>Later, he was placed on the injured list due to an ankle injury on November 14, 2020.

He is a giant body in a tender soul. Only he knows that his wounds can be healed by playing hard and living a good life.</p><p>Before hopping in the ground, Leki prays, and that prayer is slightly a decent conversation to his father and younger sister Emma in heaven.</p><p>He still misses them a lot. No one can come and occupy their spot in his life. Leki has dedicated all his hard work and effort to his sister Emma.</p><p>“13 years have gone by, but her memories are not gone.”</p><p>His performance would be a tribute to her.
